# raspberry-rfid
Helps to read and write data from an RFID tag and helps to manage them.

read.py helps to read the data from the Rfid tag.This helps to know the serial number of the tag so that we can use it to further develop
write.py helphs to write the data in the tag
sum game.py is a simple game which genrate 2 numbers and ask for the sum . if the user enter correct number then the light glow green else it glow red.
Note : for this sum game to work there is a use of GPIO pins of the rasberry pi so before playing please configure the pin number in which the led are connected.

rfid.py is nothing but a simple code to identify various rfid tag and glow green when finds the correct tag.

for all these things to work make sure spi is on rasberry pi.
also make sure important libraries should be installed. I will provide the name shortly
